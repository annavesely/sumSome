Title: True Discovery Guarantee by Sum-Based Tests
Version: 1.1.1
Date: 2021-11-23
Author: Anna Vesely and Xu Chen

Description: It allows to quickly perform closed testing by sum-based global tests, and construct lower confidence bounds for the TDP, simultaneously over all subsets of hypotheses. As main features, it produces permutation-based simultaneous lower confidence bounds for the proportion of active voxels in clusters for fMRI data, and for the proportion of differentially expressed genes in pathways for gene expression data.
